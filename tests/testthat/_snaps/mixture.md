# mixtures of fixed and continuous distributions errors

    Cannot construct a mixture distribution from a combination of discrete and continuous distributions

# mixtures of multivariate and univariate errors

    Cannot construct a mixture from a combination of multivariate and univariate distributions

# mixtures of supports errors

    Component distributions must have the same support
    However the component distributions have different support:
    "0 to Inf vs. -Inf to Inf"

# incorrectly-shaped weights errors

    The first dimension of weights must be the number of distributions in the mixture (2)
    However it was 1

# mixtures with insufficient distributions errors

    `mixture()` must be passed at least 2 distributions
    The number of distributions passed was: 1
