# bad mcmc proposals are rejected

    The log density could not be evaluated at these initial values
    Try using these initials as the `values` argument in `calculate()` to see what values of subsequent <greta_array>s these initial values lead to.

    Could not find reasonable starting values after 20 attempts.
    Please specify initial values manually via the `initial_values` argument

# mcmc handles initial values nicely

    The number of provided initial values does not match chains
    3 sets of initial values were provided, but there are 2 chains

    The initial values provided have different dimensions than the named <greta_array>s

        verbose = FALSE)
    Message
      only one set of initial values was provided, and was used for all chains

# model errors nicely

    Code
